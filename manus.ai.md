# Password Strength Analyzer and Custom Wordlist Generator Prototype

## 1. Features

### 1.1 Password Strength Analysis
- **Input**: User-provided password.
- **Method**: Utilize `zxcvbn` for comprehensive strength assessment (time to crack, warnings, suggestions).
- **Output**: Detailed strength report including:
    - Estimated crack time.
    - Security warnings (e.g., common patterns, easily guessable).
    - Suggestions for improvement.

### 1.2 Custom Wordlist Generation
- **Input**: User-provided personal information (e.g., name, date of birth, pet's name, significant places, hobbies).
- **Core Generation**: Combine inputs in various permutations and transformations.
- **Common Patterns Inclusion**:
    - **Leetspeak**: Automatic conversion of letters to numbers/symbols (e.g., 'a' -> '4', 'e' -> '3', 's' -> '5').
    - **Year Appending**: Append common year ranges (e.g., 1990-2025) to generated words.
    - **Case Variations**: Generate variations with different casing (e.g., `password`, `Password`, `PASSWORD`).
    - **Special Character Appending**: Append common special characters (e.g., `!`, `@`, `#`, `$`).
- **Filtering**: Remove duplicates and short/unlikely combinations.
- **Output**: A `.txt` file containing the generated wordlist, suitable for cracking tools.

### 1.3 Telegram Bot Interface
- **User Interaction**: Commands for initiating password analysis (`/analyze <password>`) and wordlist generation (`/generate`).
- **Input Collection**: Interactive prompts for gathering personal information for wordlist generation.
- **Output Delivery**: Send strength reports and wordlist files directly to the user via Telegram.
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly messages for invalid inputs or errors.

### 1.4 Data Storage and Analysis (for future updates)
- **Anonymized Data Collection**: Collect anonymized data on tool usage (e.g., number of analyses, wordlists generated, common warnings) for future improvements.
- **Secure Transmission**: Transmit data to a separate, dedicated Telegram bot for analysis.
- **Privacy**: Emphasize strict adherence to user privacy; no sensitive password or personal information will be stored or transmitted.

### Explanation of Directories and Files:

- `password_tool_prototype/`: The root directory of the project.

- `bot/`:
    - `main.py`: Contains the main Telegram bot logic, initialization, and command registration.
    - `handlers.py`: Defines functions to handle various Telegram bot commands and messages.

- `core/`:
    - `password_analyzer.py`: Implements the password strength analysis logic using `zxcvbn` or custom entropy calculations.
    - `wordlist_generator.py`: Contains the logic for generating custom wordlists based on user inputs and common patterns.

- `utils/`:
    - `common.py`: Utility functions that might be used across different modules (e.g., leetspeak conversion, year appending logic).

- `config.py`: Stores configuration variables like Telegram bot tokens, API keys, etc.

- `requirements.txt`: Lists all Python dependencies required for the project (e.g., `python-telegram-bot`, `zxcvbn`, `nltk`).

- `README.md`: Provides an overview of the project, setup instructions, and usage guidelines.

- `.env`: (Optional) For storing environment variables, especially sensitive ones like bot tokens, not to be committed to version control.




## 3. Technical Considerations

### 3.1 Python Libraries
- **`python-telegram-bot`**: For building the Telegram bot interface and handling user interactions.
- **`zxcvbn`**: A robust password strength estimator that provides detailed analysis, warnings, and suggestions. This will be the primary library for password strength analysis.
- **`nltk` (Natural Language Toolkit)**: While not explicitly used for the core functionality described, `NLTK` could be considered for more advanced wordlist generation features in the future, such as natural language processing for more intelligent pattern recognition or dictionary attacks. For this prototype, its direct use is minimal, but it's listed as a potential tool for future enhancements.
- **`argparse`**: This library is typically used for parsing command-line arguments. Since the primary interface for this tool will be a Telegram bot, `argparse` won't be directly used for user interaction within the bot. However, it could be used for a separate CLI version of the tool or for internal scripts for testing or maintenance.

### 3.2 Implementation Flow (Telegram Bot)
1. **Bot Initialization**: The `main.py` in the `bot/` directory will initialize the Telegram bot with its token.
2. **Command Handling**: Define handlers for commands like `/start`, `/analyze`, and `/generate` in `handlers.py`.
3. **Password Analysis**: When `/analyze <password>` is received, the `password_analyzer.py` module will be called to process the password using `zxcvbn`.
4. **Wordlist Generation**: When `/generate` is received, the bot will prompt the user for personal information. This information will then be passed to `wordlist_generator.py` to create the custom wordlist.
5. **File Export**: The generated wordlist will be saved as a `.txt` file and sent back to the user via Telegram.

### 3.3 Data Transmission for Analysis
- A separate Telegram bot will be used as a secure endpoint for receiving anonymized usage data. This will involve:
    - **Data Structuring**: Defining a clear, anonymized data structure for usage metrics (e.g., timestamp, feature used, general outcome).
    - **Secure API Calls**: The main bot will make secure API calls to the analysis bot's API to transmit this data.
    - **Privacy-by-Design**: Ensuring no personally identifiable information (PII) or sensitive data (like actual passwords or personal inputs) is ever transmitted to the analysis bot.
